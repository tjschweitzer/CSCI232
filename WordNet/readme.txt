 *  Describe concisely the data structure(s) you used to store the 
 *  information in synsets.txt. Why did you make this choice?
 *****************************************************************************/

I used 2 hasmaps
 - the key is the idValue (stored as an interger) and the value is a Bag of strings
 	-this way i would be able to access all the nouns from a .get() command and i used a bag of ints due to order not mattering
 	 
 - the key is a nouns (stored as string) and the value is a Bag of intergers 
 	- this was when using get()  you will get a bag of id's where the noun is in the DAG

Description:



Order of growth of running time:


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely your algorithm to compute the shortest common
 *  ancestor in ShortestCommonAncestor. For each method, what is the order of
 *  growth of the worst-case running time as a function of the number of
 *  vertices V and the number of edges E in the digraph? For each method,
 *  what is the order of growth of the best-case running time?
 *
 *  If you use hashing, you should assume the uniform hashing assumption
 *  so that put() and get() take constant time.
 *
 *  Be careful! If you use a BreadthFirstDirectedPaths object, don't
 *  forget to count the time needed to initialize the marked[],
 *  edgeTo[], and distTo[] arrays.
