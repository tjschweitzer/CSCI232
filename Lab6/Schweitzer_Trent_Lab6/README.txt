Part 1












It looks like the exponential value is larger then N  so we can infer the big O is around Nlog N

Reasonable values of N would be a range between 1,000,000 and 100,000,000




Part 2

We can see that we get and exp if we add the add and the sort we get around 1.5


















What is the time spent in the construction phase and the removal phase for these input sizes?
Do these agree with the expected rate of runtime growth? This do agree with the expected run time 

n particular, what percentage of time does heapsort spend in the construction phase for N = 104, 106, and 108.   


it looks like I got around 13 to 6 % time for construction
